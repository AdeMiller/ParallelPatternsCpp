# Parallel Programming with Microsoft Visual C++

**Design Patterns for Decomposition and Coordination on Multicore Architectures**  
Colin Campbell and Ade Miller. Forewords by Tony Hey and Herb Sutter

<img align="left" src="docs/Home_cover.png"/>  A book that introduces C++ programmers to patterns for including parallelism in their applications. Examples of these 
patterns are parallel loops, parallel tasks and data aggregation with map-reduce. Each pattern has its own chapter. 
Each chapter includes a description of the problem, an example of where the pattern is applicable, and code that 
implements the solution. On this site you will find; the accompanying code samples as well as answers to the end 
of chapter questions.

**[Download the samples for each chapter](http://parallelpatternscpp.codeplex.com/releases/view/60830 "Book Companion Release 1.0")**

The samples are written in C++ and use the [Parallel Patterns Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492418.aspx "Parallel Patterns Library") and [Asynchronous Agents Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492627.aspx "Asynchronous Agents Library") that shipped with [Visual Studio 2010](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions).

**System Requirements**  

You will need Visual C++ and at least [Visual C++ 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/express/) to run the samples. However, you will need [Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate<span> </span>](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/download) to use some the parallel diagnostic tools such as the Concurrency Visualizer.
